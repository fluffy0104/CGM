## CGM
This file contains all of the dataset we have used in our project and provides the detailed coding on data merging, cleaning, and analysing

## pre-test
This file only contains Tradhist dataset where we applied it in CART, RF, and LASSO, because we want to check the potential important features in our primary dataset and get rid of the less important ones so as to retain as much information as possible when doing data cleaning. What's more, we want to see how different it would be in terms of model selection when we extend this primary dataset to include other covariates (i.e. greenhouse gas emissions and inflation rate).
